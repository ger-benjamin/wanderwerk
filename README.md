Wanderwerk (to V1)
=======================
  The Wanderwerk project is a  online mapping application developed for Scouts to calculate the profile of their hikes.
Nevertheless, it can be quite usefulany walker, jogger, cyclist etc.
The program displays a map provided by the services of the federal office of topography. On which map,
the user draws some routes using an appropriate tool and then adds the important points on the routes (eg ski club cabin, panorama, place of picnic etc..).
It also can set some data like speed, pauses, etc.
After this, it starts the calculation and dataof profile is displayed. So, you can see name, altitude,
distance (km and effort km), and time between each points.
A graphique is also available to show you the slope.
You can easily compare some path even if you don't follows routes.
Currently work only in switzerland
